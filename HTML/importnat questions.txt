GET Method:
The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server.
Data is sent as part of the URL, appended as query strings (e.g., ?name=John&age=30).
Limited data size (typically 2048 characters).
Data is visible in the URL, so sensitive data should not be sent using GET.
Can be cached by the browser, so data may not be up-to-date.
Can be bookmarked, as the URL contains all the necessary data.


POST Method:
The POST method is used to send data to a server for processing.
Data is sent in the request body, not as part of the URL.
No data size limit, as data is sent separately from the URL.
Data is not visible in the URL, making it more secure for sensitive data.
Not cached by the browser, ensuring up-to-date data.
Cannot be bookmarked, as the URL does not contain the data.

Key differences:
Visibility: GET data is visible in the URL, while POST data is not.
Data size: GET has a limited data size, while POST has no limit.
Caching: GET data may be cached, while POST data is not.
Security: POST is more secure for sensitive data, as it's not visible in the URL.
When to use each:

Use GET for:
Retrieving data without modifying it.
Simple searches or queries.
Data that can be publicly shared.
Use POST for:
Sending sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).
Creating, updating, or deleting data.
Large data transfers or file uploads.
Remember, these are general guidelines, and the choice between GET and POST ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your application.
